'War. War never changes. The Romans waged war to gather slaves and wealth. Spain built an empire from its lust for gold and territory. Hitler shaped a battered Germany into an economic superpower. But war never changes. '

'Ron Pearlman, Falout'

Encrypting communication has been a tool in many wars to achieve victory. 

During the second world war, the German designed Enigma, a machine that was able to encrypt messages and allow free and secure communication between them. 

Turing was one of the brave mind who tried to tackle this massive decryption initiative. 

Enigma's code could be cracked ! While the possiblities where numerous, he designed a machine that could test the possible combinations, not only faster but more systematically then what the wold most eminent cryptographers where able to do at that time. 

We have already seen Caesar shifts and while we will not see the specifics of Enigma and the tools to solve this problem ( yet ;) , we will go one step further in term of complexity and learn about Vigenere cipher. 


Question 1 

An old scholar presents you with a passage from a curious book,he thinks that it is written in a old tongue and wants your advice on the case. You think It might be appropriate to try some of your decription tehcniques before giving up.
